### 1.2.0 / 2012-06-03

* Documentation and comment clean-up
* Implemented guard on to_s for unknown % tokens.

### 1.1.10 / 2012-06-01

* Implemented faster Date#.to_s method.

### 1.1.9 / 2012-05-31

* BugFix: to_s will preserve minus sign for negative year when formatter starts with %Y
* BugFix: <=> correct for negative dates.

### 1.1.8 / 2012-05-30

* Implemented to_s formatters.

### 1.1.7 / 2012-05-30

* BugFix: Another logical error in to_s - fixed (formatters next).

### 1.1.6 / 2012-05-30

* Bugfix: Checked that sign is switched off when a postive year is set after a negative year.
* Bugfix: Fixed to_s again (before formatters are implemented).

### 1.1.5 / 2012-05-30

* Allow negative years and year range from -1048576 to 1048576 (20 bits).
* Implemented negative year with signing mask.
* Year is no longer mandatory
* Created more specific error classes
* Implemented readonly attribute Date#bits to allow public access to the bit store for comparison in <=>.
* Moved bits.rb back into date.rb


### 1.1.4 / 2012-05-29

* Changed error messages for month and day to 0 - 12 and 0 - 31 respectively (since zero values are allowed).
